In units where small bowel access is feasible, we recommend the routine use of small bowel feedings. In units where obtaining access involves more logistical difficulties, small bowel feedings should be considered for patients at high risk for intolerance to EN (on inotropes, continuous infusion of sedatives, or paralytic agents, or patients with high nasogastric drainage) or at high risk for regurgitation and aspiration (nursed in supine position). Finally, where obtaining small bowel access is not feasible (no access to fluoroscopy or endoscopy and blind techniques not reliable), small bowel feedings should be considered for those select patients that repeatedly demonstrate high gastric residuals and are not tolerating adequate amounts of EN intragastrically.","['Pneumonia', 'Enteral', 'Access', 'Enteral', 'Intorlerance', 'Regurgitation', 'Aspiration', 'Small', 'Bowel', 'Access', 'High', 'Gastric', 'Residuals', 'Small', 'Bowel', 'Feeding']"
